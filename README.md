# TicTacToe
A classic Tic tac toe game, you against the computer

To play you need to install the Python package "pygame". Then downloadd the 4 files and just run 'runner.py'. Have fun :)

I just coded the logical part. The graphic is provided by the course "CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python"
